# Address Book - Laravel
Build a basic address book app using Laravel 5.1. The app should demonstrate the CRUD pattern: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

### What is Laravel?
* Laravel is a framework used to create PHP applications.
* It provides shortcults, tools and components to complete web based projects.

### Starting the Project
* Installed Composer & Laravel
* Set up a server on localhost:8888 using PHP
* Installed Virtual Box & Vagrant
* Successfully installed Homestead but kept getting timeout errors in the browser. Decided to use PHP's built-in server instead.
* Created an initial new controller and returned 'hello world' to the browser.
* Went from PHP's built-in server to MAMP.

### Thoughts and Issues
* While creating the application, I did come up with some issues, but I managed to solve them all. Some of the issues included:
  * Getting timeout errors when trying to start up Homestead. Now that the project is complete, I think it may have had something to do with creating my database.
    * I solved this problem by switching to MAMP.
  * Getting 'illuminate' and the laravel forms to work in the browser.
    * I solved this problem through research. Laravel and Illuminate have been recently updated, so there are now different ways to get form outputs.
* I did have some other bugs along the way, but I managed to get everything working.

### Further Questions
* I would like to find out how to resolve my 'timeout' issue while trying to get Homestead / Virtual Box / Vagrant running.
* I would love to know what in this project I could have done better!
