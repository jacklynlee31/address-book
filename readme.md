# Address Book - Laravel
Build a basic address book app using Laravel 5.1. The app should demonstrate the CRUD pattern: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

### What is Laravel?
* Laravel is a framework used to create PHP applications.
* It provides shortcults, tools and components to complete web based projects.

### Completing the Project
* Installed Composer & Laravel
* Set up a server on localhost:8888 using PHP
* Installed Virtual Box & Vagrant
* Successfully installed Homestead but kept getting timeout errors in the browser. Decided to use PHP's built-in server instead.
* Created an initial new controller and returned 'hello world' to the browser.

### Further Questions
* I would like to find out how to resolve my 'timeout' issue while trying to get the Virtual Box / Vagrant running.
